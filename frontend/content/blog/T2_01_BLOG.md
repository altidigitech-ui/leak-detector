# Why 57% of SaaS Landing Pages Have a CTA Problem (And How to Fix Yours)

When we [audited 50 SaaS landing pages](/blog/analyzed-50-saas-landing-pages-conversion-killers), CTA effectiveness had the widest score range of any category: 15 to 90. That 75-point gap means some companies are nailing their calls-to-action while others are practically sabotaging their own conversion funnels.

The average CTA score was 65.1/100, and 57.5% of pages scored below 70. That makes CTA the second most problematic category we measured — and arguably the most impactful to fix, since every visitor interaction funnels through that button.

Here's what the data revealed about what works and what doesn't.

## The Three CTA Sins

Across 40 audited pages, we flagged the same three issues repeatedly.

### 1. Generic Button Text That Says Nothing

"Get started." "Book a demo." "Sign up free." These appeared on the majority of pages we audited. They're not wrong — they're just empty. They tell the visitor what action to take without communicating why they should take it.

The problem isn't that "Get started" is bad copy. It's that it's identical to every competitor. When a visitor is comparing three SaaS tools in different tabs, generic CTAs give them zero reason to click yours over the other two.

Pages that scored 80+ on CTA used text that included a specific outcome or benefit. The button didn't just name the action — it previewed the result. There's a meaningful difference between asking someone to "Start free trial" versus telling them they can "Build your first page in 5 minutes."

The highest-scoring CTAs also included supporting context near the button: trial duration, whether a credit card is required, what happens immediately after clicking. This micro-copy reduces friction by answering objections before they form.

### 2. Competing CTAs Without Clear Hierarchy

Spendesk's page shows both "Book a demo" and "Tour the Spendesk app" as co-equal options. Several other pages in our study had similar patterns: two or three CTAs competing for attention with roughly equal visual weight.

This creates what conversion researchers call decision paralysis. When presented with two equal options, a significant percentage of visitors choose neither. The cognitive effort of evaluating which action is "right" becomes a friction point.

The pages that scored highest had a clear primary CTA — visually dominant through size, color, and placement — with secondary options deliberately de-emphasized. The secondary CTA exists for visitors who aren't ready for the primary action, but it never competes for attention.

A practical test: if you screenshot your hero section and squint, can you immediately identify one dominant action? If two buttons look roughly equal, you have a hierarchy problem.

### 3. No Urgency or Differentiation

Almost none of the 40 pages we audited created any sense of time pressure or scarcity. Now, fake urgency is worse than no urgency — countdown timers for nothing are transparently manipulative. But legitimate urgency signals were almost entirely absent.

Things that work without being manipulative: limited free tier capacity, specific launch dates for new features, seasonal pricing, or even simple time-to-value statements ("Set up in under 3 minutes"). These aren't pressure tactics. They're information that helps visitors make a decision now rather than bookmarking and forgetting.

## What 90-Score CTAs Look Like

The pages at the top of our CTA scores shared a pattern. No single page had all of these elements, but the best ones combined at least three:

**A benefit-first primary button.** The copy communicates what the visitor gets, not just what they do. The outcome is specific enough that the visitor can picture it.

**One dominant visual action.** The primary CTA is unmistakably the main thing to do on the page. Color, size, whitespace, and positioning all point to it.

**Supporting micro-copy.** Text near the button that removes objections: "Free forever for small teams," "No credit card required," "Takes 30 seconds."

**Strategic repetition.** The CTA appears at least twice — once above the fold and once after the visitor has consumed key content. Same action, same benefit, reinforced at the moment the visitor is most convinced.

**Contextual placement.** The CTA appears after proof, not before. A button right after a testimonial or data point converts better than one floating in isolation.

## The Quick Fix Framework

If your CTA scores below 70, here's a prioritized approach:

**First, rewrite the button text.** Take your current CTA and add a specific benefit. If it says "Get started," change it to include what happens after clicking. What does the visitor achieve in their first session? Lead with that.

**Second, establish hierarchy.** If you have multiple CTAs, make one visually dominant. Reduce the secondary option to a text link or a ghost button. The visitor's eye should be drawn to one action without effort.

**Third, add micro-copy.** Below or beside your button, address the top objection. For most SaaS, that's cost ("Free plan available"), commitment ("Cancel anytime"), or time ("2-minute setup"). One line of text here can meaningfully move conversion rates.

**Fourth, test placement.** Ensure your CTA appears above the fold AND after your strongest piece of social proof or value explanation. The first instance catches ready buyers. The second catches visitors who needed convincing.

## How to Measure Improvement

After making changes, measure two things: click-through rate on the CTA itself, and the conversion rate from page visit to completed signup or demo booking. A better CTA should move both, but they can diverge — a more compelling button might attract more clicks while a misleading one might increase clicks but reduce actual conversions.

If you want an objective before-and-after comparison, [run your page through Leak Detector](https://leakdetector.tech) before you make changes and again after. The CTA category score gives you a standardized benchmark against the [industry averages we've published](/blog/saas-landing-page-benchmarks-2026).
