# SaaS Landing Page Benchmarks (2026): Scores Across 8 Conversion Categories

When someone asks "is my landing page good?", the real question is: compared to what?

We audited 50 SaaS landing pages using [Leak Detector](https://leakdetector.tech) and compiled the benchmarks below. These aren't self-reported conversion rates or vanity metrics — they're standardized scores across 8 categories that directly impact whether visitors convert or bounce.

Use these numbers to see where your page stands relative to the SaaS average, and where the biggest opportunities are hiding.

## Overall Benchmarks at a Glance

Based on 40 fully audited SaaS pages:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Average Overall Score** | 72.7 / 100 |
| **Median Score** | 72 / 100 |
| **Highest Score** | 82 (Lemon Squeezy) |
| **Lowest Score** | 25 (Slack Pricing) |
| **Standard Range** | 67 – 78 |

If your page scores above 78, you're outperforming the majority of SaaS landing pages. Below 67, you have significant room for improvement.

## Category Benchmarks

Each page was scored across 8 categories. Here's the average, the range, and what percentage of pages failed (scored below 70) in each:

| Category | Average | Min | Max | % Below 70 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mobile Responsiveness | **81.5** | 40 | 90 | 2.5% |
| Trust Signals | **80.5** | 55 | 95 | 10% |
| Visual Hierarchy | **78.7** | 30 | 92 | 7.5% |
| Headline & Value Prop | **74.5** | 10 | 90 | 30% |
| Performance / Speed | **68.5** | 25 | 95 | 40% |
| CTA Effectiveness | **65.1** | 15 | 90 | 57.5% |
| Form & Lead Capture | **64.9** | 0 | 100 | 47% |
| Social Proof | **60.1** | 0 | 95 | 59% |

The data splits into two distinct tiers. Mobile, trust, and visual hierarchy are generally handled well — these are solved problems for most SaaS teams in 2026. But CTA, forms, social proof, and performance still fail on the majority of pages.

**The takeaway: if you're optimizing your landing page, start at the bottom of this table, not the top.** Social proof, forms, and CTAs offer the highest upside because the current bar is so low.

## Benchmarks by SaaS Segment

We grouped pages into 6 segments. The differences are revealing:

| Segment | Avg Score | Best Category | Worst Category |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Indie SaaS** | 75 | Trust Signals (83) | Social Proof (58) |
| **Established SaaS** | 74 | Mobile (84) | Forms (52) |
| **Landing Page Builders** | 74 | Visual Hierarchy (82) | Social Proof (56) |
| **French SaaS** | 74 | Trust Signals (84) | CTA (62) |
| **Marketing/CRO Tools** | 73 | Trust Signals (82) | Social Proof (60) |
| **Pricing Pages** | 57 | Trust Signals (72) | Forms (38) |

Three things stand out.

**Indie SaaS slightly outperforms established players.** Smaller teams with newer pages tend to be more intentional about conversion elements. The tools built by solo founders and small teams — Lemon Squeezy, Tally, Plausible — actually score marginally better than Stripe, Notion, and Figma. This isn't because their products are better. It's because indie founders treat their landing page as a core product surface, while larger companies often treat theirs as a marketing afterthought.

**Pricing pages are a disaster.** At 57/100, pricing pages underperform every other segment by at least 16 points. This is alarming because pricing pages typically receive the highest-intent traffic on any SaaS site. If your homepage scores 74 but your pricing page scores 57, you're losing visitors who already decided they wanted to buy.

**Every segment's worst category is either Social Proof or Forms.** No matter what type of SaaS you run, these two areas are where you're most likely underperforming.

## Detailed Category Benchmarks

### Headline & Value Proposition

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Average | 74.5 |
| Top performer | 90 |
| Bottom performer | 10 |
| % Below 70 | 30% |

Nearly a third of pages have headline problems. The most common issue: abstract taglines that sound impressive but don't communicate what the product actually does. "Where Finance Connects" (Spendesk) and similarly vague headlines force visitors to scroll further to understand the offer — and many won't.

**Benchmark to beat:** Pages scoring 85+ lead with a specific, outcome-oriented headline. They answer "what does this do for me?" in the first line.

### CTA (Call-to-Action)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Average | 65.1 |
| Top performer | 90 |
| Bottom performer | 15 |
| % Below 70 | 57.5% |

The category with the widest range (15 to 90) and second-highest failure rate. This is where the biggest conversion gains are available.

**Benchmark to beat:** High-scoring CTAs (80+) share three traits: benefit-oriented copy rather than generic verbs, a single visually dominant primary CTA, and supporting context near the button (e.g., "Free 14-day trial · No credit card required").

### Social Proof

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Average | 60.1 |
| Top performer | 95 |
| Bottom performer | 0 |
| % Below 70 | 59% |

The weakest category across the board. Multiple pages scored zero — meaning no customer evidence was visible in the analyzed content. The gap between best (95) and worst (0) tells the full story: some companies invest heavily in social proof while others ignore it entirely.

**Benchmark to beat:** Pages scoring 85+ combine at least three types of proof: specific usage numbers, named customer testimonials, and third-party review scores. Logo bars alone don't get above 65.

### Forms & Lead Capture

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Average | 64.9 |
| Top performer | 100 |
| Bottom performer | 0 |
| % Below 70 | 47% |

The most polarized category: pages either nail it (100) or completely skip it (0). "No lead generation form present" was the most frequently flagged issue in our entire study.

**Benchmark to beat:** Top scorers offer multiple capture paths at different commitment levels. A free tool or resource alongside the primary CTA. A newsletter signup in the footer. Any low-friction option for visitors who aren't ready to buy today.

### Performance / Page Speed

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Average | 68.5 |
| Top performer | 95 |
| Bottom performer | 25 |
| % Below 70 | 40% |

Four out of ten pages had performance scores below 70. Additionally, 8 out of 48 pages couldn't even complete analysis within 30 seconds — heavy JavaScript rendering made them too slow for automated tools, which means real visitors on mobile connections are suffering too.

**Benchmark to beat:** Pages scoring 85+ load in under 2 seconds, use fewer than 30 images, and implement lazy loading. The single biggest drag on performance scores was excessive image count.

### Visual Hierarchy, Trust, and Mobile

These three categories are generally well-handled across the SaaS industry:

| Category | Average | % Below 70 |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | 81.5 | 2.5% |
| Trust Signals | 80.5 | 10% |
| Visual Hierarchy | 78.7 | 7.5% |

Mobile responsiveness is essentially a solved problem in 2026 — only one page scored below 70. Trust signals (HTTPS, company information, security badges) are also standard. Visual hierarchy is generally good, though some pages struggle with feature section organization.

**If you're already above 75 in these categories, your optimization time is better spent on CTA, social proof, and forms.**

## How to Use These Benchmarks

**Step 1:** Audit your landing page. You can run a [free analysis on Leak Detector](https://leakdetector.tech) to get your scores across all 8 categories.

**Step 2:** Compare against the averages above. Any category where you score below the industry average is a priority.

**Step 3:** Focus on the high-failure categories first. If your social proof scores below 60, or your CTA is under 65, fixing those will have more impact than optimizing your already-decent visual hierarchy.

**Step 4:** Re-audit after changes. Benchmarks are only useful if you track improvement over time.

## A Note on Methodology

These benchmarks are based on 40 fully completed AI-powered audits of SaaS landing pages (from an initial set of 48, with 8 timeouts or access blocks). Pages were analyzed in January–February 2026 and scored at a single point in time. Companies regularly update their landing pages, so individual scores may not reflect the current state.

We'll update these benchmarks quarterly as we accumulate more data. If you'd like your page included in the next round, [submit it for a free audit](https://leakdetector.tech).
