# How to Audit Your Landing Page in 30 Seconds (Free)

You built a landing page. Traffic is coming in. But conversions are disappointing and you're not sure why. The page looks good to you — but you've stared at it so long that you can't see it objectively anymore.

You could hire a CRO consultant. That'll cost you $2,000–$5,000 and take two to four weeks. You could read a dozen blog posts on landing page best practices and try to self-diagnose. That'll take hours and you'll still miss things because it's hard to audit your own work.

Or you can run a structured audit in 30 seconds and get a prioritized list of what to fix first.

Here's how.

## What a Landing Page Audit Actually Checks

A proper audit isn't just a gut check or a design critique. It's a systematic evaluation of the elements that research and data show impact conversion rates. Based on our [analysis of 50 SaaS landing pages](/blog/analyzed-50-saas-landing-pages-conversion-killers), we identified 8 categories that matter:

**1. Headline & Value Proposition** — Does your visitor understand what you offer within 5 seconds? Is the benefit clear and specific, or vague and abstract? [30% of SaaS pages fail this](/blog/saas-headline-value-proposition).

**2. Call-to-Action** — Is there one clear primary action? Does the button text communicate a benefit? Is there visual hierarchy between primary and secondary CTAs? [57% of pages have a CTA problem](/blog/saas-landing-page-cta-problem).

**3. Social Proof** — Are there testimonials, usage numbers, review scores, or client logos visible? Are they specific and attributed, or generic? [59% of pages fail here](/blog/saas-social-proof-problem).

**4. Forms & Lead Capture** — Is there a way to capture visitors who aren't ready to buy yet? Is the form minimal or overloaded with fields? [47% have no capture strategy](/blog/saas-form-lead-capture-problem).

**5. Visual Hierarchy** — Does the eye naturally flow from headline to value prop to proof to CTA? Or does the visitor's attention scatter? [Only 7.5% fail this](/blog/saas-visual-hierarchy).

**6. Trust Signals** — Are security certifications, compliance badges, and company information visible on the page? [10% miss this](/blog/saas-trust-signals).

**7. Mobile Experience** — Does the page work on phones? More importantly, does it *convert* on phones? [Mostly solved, but edge cases exist](/blog/saas-mobile-optimization).

**8. Performance** — How fast does the page load? Is it under 2 seconds? Are images optimized? [40% have speed issues](/blog/saas-page-speed-performance).

## The Manual Audit: 5-Minute Version

If you want to do this yourself, here's a quick framework. Open your landing page in an incognito browser window (to clear any cached state) and answer these questions honestly:

**Headline test.** Read only the headline and subheadline. Can a stranger tell what your product does and who it's for? If the answer requires scrolling, you have a problem.

**CTA test.** Without scrolling, can you identify one clear action to take? Is the button text specific ("Start your free trial — no credit card") or generic ("Get started")? Count the number of competing CTAs above the fold. More than one with equal visual weight is a red flag.

**Social proof test.** Is there any customer evidence visible without scrolling? Not a logo bar buried at the bottom — visible, specific proof in the first viewport. Testimonials with names? Usage numbers? Review scores?

**Form test.** How many fields does your primary conversion form have? Each field beyond email reduces completion rate. Is there a secondary, low-friction capture option (newsletter, free resource) for visitors who aren't ready for the primary action?

**Speed test.** Open your page on your phone with a real mobile connection (not WiFi). Count to three. Is meaningful content visible? If not, you have a performance issue that's costing you visitors.

This manual audit takes about 5 minutes and catches the most obvious issues. The limitation is that you're still evaluating your own page with your own biases. You know what the headline means. You know where the CTA is. A first-time visitor doesn't.

## The Automated Audit: 30 Seconds

This is where tooling helps. An automated audit evaluates your page the way a first-time visitor experiences it — without prior context, brand recognition, or familiarity with the layout.

[Leak Detector](https://leakdetector.tech) runs a full 8-category audit in under 30 seconds. Here's what happens:

**Step 1: Enter your URL.** Just the landing page URL you want to analyze. No account needed for the basic audit.

**Step 2: The tool loads your page.** It renders the page in a real browser, capturing the full DOM, images, load time, and content. This means it sees what a real visitor sees — not just the source code.

**Step 3: AI analysis.** Each of the 8 categories is evaluated against conversion best practices and [benchmarked against industry data](/blog/saas-landing-page-benchmarks-2026) from our 50-page study.

**Step 4: You get your results.** An overall score (0–100), individual category scores, specific issues flagged by severity (Critical, Warning, Info), and actionable recommendations for each issue.

The free version gives you the overall score and top issues. The full report breaks down every category with detailed explanations and fix priorities.

## How to Read Your Results

Once you have your audit results, here's how to prioritize:

**Fix Critical issues first.** These are the conversion killers — things that are actively driving visitors away. A missing CTA above the fold, zero social proof, a form that doesn't work on mobile. These take priority over everything else.

**Then tackle Warnings.** These are significant issues that hurt conversion but aren't deal-breakers. A generic headline that could be more specific, a CTA that works but isn't optimized, load time that's acceptable but not great.

**Info items are optimizations.** They represent the difference between a good page and a great one. Address them after the Critical and Warning items are resolved.

**Compare against benchmarks.** Your scores mean more in context. If your CTA scores 60 but the [industry average is 65](/blog/saas-landing-page-benchmarks-2026), you're slightly below par. If your social proof scores 40 against an average of 60, that's a significant gap worth prioritizing.

## The Most Common Results We See

Based on thousands of audits, the issues that appear most frequently are remarkably consistent:

**"No lead generation form present" — flagged on ~47% of pages.** The single most common issue. Most pages only offer a high-commitment action (signup, demo booking) with no low-friction alternative.

**"Generic CTA without benefit" — flagged on ~40% of pages.** "Get started" and "Sign up" without any supporting context about what the visitor will gain.

**"Missing or insufficient social proof" — flagged on ~35% of pages.** No testimonials, no numbers, no third-party validation above the fold.

**"Page load time exceeds threshold" — flagged on ~25% of pages.** Usually caused by unoptimized images, excessive third-party scripts, or JavaScript-heavy rendering.

If your audit flags one or more of these, you're in the majority. The difference is that now you know about it and can fix it.

## After the Audit: What to Do

Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick the single highest-severity issue in the category where you score lowest. Fix that one thing. Then re-audit to confirm the improvement and identify the next priority.

This iterative approach works better than a full redesign because each change is measurable. You can see exactly which fix moved your score and, more importantly, which fix moved your conversion rate.

For ongoing optimization, re-audit monthly. Landing pages aren't static — content changes, traffic sources shift, and competitor pages evolve. A monthly audit catches regression before it costs you significant conversions.
