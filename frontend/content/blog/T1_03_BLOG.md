# We Audited the Landing Pages of Landing Page Builders — They're Average

There's a category of SaaS companies that literally sells the promise of better-converting landing pages. Unbounce. Instapage. Leadpages. Framer. Carrd. Webflow. Typedream.

Their pitch, in various forms, boils down to: *use our tool and your pages will convert better.*

So we asked a simple question: how well do their own landing pages convert?

We ran each one through [Leak Detector](https://leakdetector.tech), which scores pages across 8 categories — headline clarity, CTA, social proof, forms, visual hierarchy, trust signals, mobile, and performance. We compared them against 40+ other SaaS landing pages across the industry.

The result: **landing page builders scored 74/100 on average — exactly the industry mean.**

The companies selling you conversion optimization are performing at the same level as everyone else.

## The Scores

| Company | Overall Score | Best Category | Worst Category |
|---|---|---|---|
| Instapage | 78 | Trust (90) | Social Proof (55) |
| Framer | 78 | Visual Hierarchy (88) | Forms (50) |
| Unbounce | 72 | Headline (80) | Performance (55) |
| Leadpages | 72 | Mobile (85) | Social Proof (50) |
| Carrd | 72 | Performance (85) | Social Proof (40) |
| Typedream | 72 | Visual Hierarchy (82) | Social Proof (48) |
| Webflow | *Timeout* | — | — |

For context, the overall average across all 40 SaaS pages we audited was 72.7. Indie SaaS tools like Lemon Squeezy (82) and Tally (78) outperformed most of the builders.

And Webflow — one of the biggest names in the space — couldn't even complete the audit. The page timed out after 30 seconds of loading. A website builder whose own website is too heavy to fully render in 30 seconds.

## The Social Proof Blind Spot

Look at the "worst category" column. Five out of six builders scored lowest on **social proof**.

This is striking because landing page builders are sitting on the best possible social proof data in the industry. They know exactly how many pages have been created on their platform. They have conversion data. They have success stories. Their customers are, by definition, people who care about landing page performance.

And yet, their own pages underperform the industry average on the one element that matters most.

Carrd scored 40 on social proof. Typedream scored 48. These are scores you'd expect from a pre-launch startup, not from companies with thousands of paying customers.

The industry average for social proof across our full study was 60 — already low. Builders averaged **50**. They're 10 points below a bar that's already on the floor.

What's missing? The same things we flagged across the full study: specific customer testimonials with names and results, verifiable usage numbers above the fold, and third-party validation. Logo bars appear on most builder pages, but logos alone don't move the needle. We consistently saw that pages combining logos with specific data points ("150,000+ pages created" or "Average 32% conversion rate increase") scored 20+ points higher on social proof than those relying on logos alone.

## CTA: Functional but Uninspired

Builder CTAs scored around the industry average — not terrible, but not impressive either. The common pattern: "Get started free" or "Start building" as the primary CTA.

These are functional. They tell you what to do. But they don't tell you what you'll get.

None of the builder pages we audited used benefit-driven CTA copy that communicated a specific outcome. Compare "Start building" (what the visitor does) with "Launch your first high-converting page in 10 minutes" (what the visitor gets). The second approach consistently scores higher in our audits because it answers the visitor's actual question: *what happens after I click?*

For companies whose core expertise is supposed to be conversion optimization, this is a missed opportunity.

## Where Builders Actually Excel

It's not all bad news. Builders did well where you'd expect:

**Visual Hierarchy (82 avg):** These companies know design. Their pages are well-structured, with clear content flow and appropriate use of whitespace. Framer in particular scored 88 — one of the highest visual hierarchy scores in our entire study.

**Mobile (83 avg):** Pages built by people who build page-building tools tend to be responsive. No surprise, but worth noting.

**Trust Signals (82 avg):** Established companies with recognizable brands, HTTPS, clear company information. Solid across the board.

The gap between their visual execution and their conversion strategy is the real story here. Builder pages *look* professional. They just don't *persuade* as effectively as they should.

## What About Performance?

Performance was mixed. Carrd — the minimalist builder — scored 85, which makes sense for a tool that prides itself on simple, fast sites. Unbounce scored 55, dragged down by page weight.

And then there's Webflow, which timed out entirely. We weren't able to complete the audit because the page didn't finish loading within our 30-second window. That's the same timeout threshold we use across all audits, and the majority of SaaS pages — including much smaller companies — complete well within it.

For a company that hosts millions of websites and promotes performance as a feature, this is worth investigating.

## The Cobbler's Children Have No Shoes

There's an old proverb: the cobbler's children go barefoot. The person who makes shoes is so busy making them for others that their own kids don't have any.

Landing page builders appear to have the same problem. They spend their resources building tools for customers to optimize conversion, but their own pages don't reflect that expertise.

Some possible explanations:

**Brand marketing vs. conversion marketing.** Larger companies often prioritize brand expression over conversion optimization on their homepages. The page becomes a statement of identity rather than a conversion machine. This is a valid strategic choice, but it produces average conversion scores.

**Internal attention goes elsewhere.** When your product *is* landing pages, your best CRO talent is probably building product features, not optimizing the company homepage. The page gets redesigned once a year and doesn't get the ongoing A/B testing treatment that customer pages do.

**Assumed credibility.** If you're Unbounce, you might assume visitors already know what you do and that you're credible. So you under-invest in the social proof and persuasion elements that a less-known company would need. The problem: new visitors who found you through a search query don't share that assumption.

## What You Can Take From This

**Don't assume the tool makes the page.** Building on Webflow or Unbounce doesn't automatically mean your page converts well. The platform provides the building blocks. The conversion strategy has to come from you.

**Social proof is undervalued everywhere** — even by companies that should know better. If landing page builders are scoring 50/100 on social proof, odds are your page has the same blind spot. Add specific testimonials, usage data, and results above the fold.

**Test your own page objectively.** It's hard to evaluate something you look at every day. An automated audit catches the issues you've become blind to. Even the companies building the audit tools need this perspective.
